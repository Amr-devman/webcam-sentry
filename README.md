# webcam-sentry

Webcam sentry is a web app that allows you to monitor your room when you are not around, all you need is a browser and a webcam!

[How it works]
Webcam sentry will allow you to whitelist people you trust to be in your room, however, if any else tries to enter the sentry will notify you using an email








the webcam.js module used for this project was adopted from https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs
